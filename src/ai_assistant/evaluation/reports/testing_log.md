   - **Fix**: Added fallback clustering methods when optimal fails
   - **Fix**: Limited PCA components to avoid invalid parameters

2. **FAISS dependency failures**
   - **Fix**: Implemented `SimpleFallbackRetriever` as alternative
   - **Fix**: Added automatic detection of FAISS availability
   - **Fix**: Created graceful degradation path for RAG functionality

3. **AIMessage type errors**
   - **Fix**: Added type checking and conversion for message types
   - **Fix**: Updated LangChain API calls to modern methods
   - **Fix**: Added content extraction from different response types

### Remaining Challenges

1. **Clustering limitations**
   - Very small datasets (<20 cells) have limited clustering utility
   - Clustering parameters may need manual tuning for optimal results
   - Current implementation may not detect rare cell populations

2. **LLM response consistency**
   - Some variability in interpretations between identical queries
   - Complex analyses sometimes require multiple attempts
   - Token limits can sometimes truncate important context

3. **Performance with large datasets**
   - Loading and processing large H5AD files can be slow
   - UMAP generation for large datasets requires optimization
   - Memory usage during visualization needs improvement

## Testing Summary Report

### What Worked Well
1. Multi-format file support worked robustly
2. RAG system with PanglaoDB integration provided accurate cell type information
3. Visualization capabilities offered meaningful data exploration
4. Compatibility mode successfully addressed dependency and threading issues
5. Evaluation metrics provided useful feedback on prediction accuracy

### What Needs Improvement
1. Clustering functionality still has limitations with small or sparse datasets
2. LLM response consistency could be improved with better prompting
3. Performance optimization for larger datasets would enhance usability
4. More robust error handling in scanpy analysis would prevent some edge case failures
